# Tensorflow


### Explanation:

The provided code is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow and Keras for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Import Libraries:**
   - TensorFlow and its components for building neural networks.
   - Matplotlib for plotting images and charts.
   - NumPy for numerical operations.

2. **Load and Preprocess CIFAR-10 Dataset:**
   - The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded, consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
   - Images are reshaped to 32x32 pixels and normalized to values between 0 and 1.

3. **Visualization of CIFAR-10 Images:**
   - A subset of training images is visualized with their corresponding labels.

4. **One-Hot Encoding:**
   - Labels are converted to one-hot encoded format.

5. **CNN Model Architecture:**
   - A CNN model is defined with three convolutional layers followed by batch normalization, max-pooling, and dropout.
   - Fully connected layers with dropout are added at the end.
   - L2 regularization is optional.

6. **Model Compilation:**
   - The model is compiled with categorical crossentropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

7. **Training:**
   - The model is trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 128 and 20% validation split.

8. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The model is evaluated on the test set, and accuracy and loss scores are printed.

9. **Plotting Training History:**
   - Training and validation loss, as well as accuracy, are plotted over epochs.
